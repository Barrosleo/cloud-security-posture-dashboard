# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Dashboard

A comprehensive tool to continuously monitor your cloud configuration settings, evaluate them against established security benchmarks, and identify misconfigurations that could lead to data breaches. This project is tailored for hybrid environments and advanced SOC operations, showcasing multi-language integration (Python, Node.js, HTML/JavaScript) and modern software engineering practices.

## Overview

Cloud-based environments are continually evolving and require constant vigilance. The CSPM Dashboard monitors cloud configuration settings—via integration with AWS, Azure, or GCP APIs—compares them against security benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, internal policies), and then flags potential misconfigurations. It computes a risk score for each resource and provides automated remediation recommendations (such as enforcing multi-factor authentication) to help SOC teams maintain a robust security posture.

This project demonstrates advanced SOC capabilities, integrating Python for data fetching and risk evaluation, Node.js for API aggregation and alerting, and an HTML/JavaScript front-end for interactive visualization using Plotly.js.

## Key Features

- **Cloud API Integration:**  
  Fetch configuration data from cloud providers (sample data is provided for demonstration).

- **Policy Evaluation & Compliance Checks:**  
  Assess cloud configurations against established security benchmarks and internal policies.

- **Risk Scoring:**  
  Compute risk scores based on deviations from best practices and compliance requirements.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Visualize security posture, configuration risk scores, and trends over time using a dynamic Plotly.js-based dashboard.

- **Automated Remediation Recommendations:**  
  Generate remediation suggestions (e.g., enable MFA, revise access controls) based on identified misconfigurations.

- **Multi-language Integration:**  
  - **Python:** Cloud configuration fetching and risk evaluation.  
  - **Node.js:** API integration, data aggregation, and alerting.  
  - **HTML/JavaScript:** Interactive front-end visualization.

---

## Architecture & Components

1. **Python Module:**  
   - **fetch_configs.py:** Connects to cloud provider APIs (or loads sample data) and retrieves configuration data.  
   - **evaluate_policies.py:** Evaluates configurations against security benchmarks and computes risk scores and remediation recommendations.

2. **Node.js API:**  
   - Acts as an integration layer that aggregates data from the Python module (or static JSON output), adds context, and exposes endpoints for front-end consumption.  
   - Can be extended to trigger alerting via email, Slack, or other notification services.

3. **Dashboard:**  
   - A static HTML/JavaScript page using Plotly.js to render interactive visualizations.  
   - Accessible via a Node.js endpoint to provide a real-time view of your cloud security posture.

For an in-depth explanation of the architecture and data flows, see the [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) file.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, boto3 (for AWS; similar libraries for Azure/GCP)
- **Node.js:** Express, Axios
- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript, Plotly.js
- **Others:** JSON/CSV for sample data, Git for version control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+ installed
- Node.js (version 12+ recommended)
- A cloud provider account (optional, for real data integration) or use provided sample data

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-security-posture-dashboard.git
   cd cloud-security-posture-dashboard

2. **Set Up the Python Module**

Navigate to the python-module directory:

  ```bash
  cd python-module
  ```
Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
Run the Python module to fetch and evaluate cloud configurations:

  ```bash
  python fetch_configs.py
  python evaluate_policies.py
  ```
Note: The sample data is located in python-module/sample_data/. Modify the scripts to connect to your actual cloud provider APIs if necessary.

3. **Set Up the Node.js API & Dashboard**

Navigate to the nodejs-api directory:

  ```bash
  cd ../nodejs-api
  ```
Install Node.js dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
Start the Node.js server:

  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
Open your browser and access the dashboard at: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## Usage

Data Evaluation: Run the Python modules to fetch cloud configurations and evaluate security compliance. Adjust thresholds and policies in evaluate_policies.py based on your security benchmarks.

API Integration: The Node.js server aggregates the evaluated data and provides endpoints (e.g., /api/configs) for the dashboard.

Dashboard Visualization: The dashboard updates dynamically to show risk scores and remediation recommendations, offering an interactive view of your cloud security posture.

## Future Enhancements

Real-Time Integration: Connect directly with live cloud provider APIs to fetch real-time configuration data.

Enhanced Risk Scoring: Develop more granular risk models and incorporate additional features for evaluation.

Automated Remediation: Integrate with alerting and remediation platforms to automatically enforce security best practices.

CI/CD Pipeline: Set up automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions or similar tools.

User Authentication: Add secure access controls for the dashboard.
